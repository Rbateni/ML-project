Abstract:
This project employs regression analysis on historical bike rental data from 2011 to 2012 to predict total rental bike counts. Initial steps involve data importation and preprocessing: examining the dataset, visualizing rental trends over days, converting categorical variables into binary dummy variables, and normalizing quantitative features for consistent scaling. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, with 75% for training and 25% for testing. Utilizing sklearn's LinearRegression module, the model is trained on the training set and evaluated using the R^2 score and RMSE on the test set. Finally, predictions on the test set are used to compute the total count of rental bikes for the given time frame. Overall, this project demonstrates the application of regression analysis to predict bike rental demand based on various factors, highlighting the model's performance through the R^2 score and RMSE and estimating the total demand for rental bikes.
